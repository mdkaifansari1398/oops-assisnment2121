        "1.What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        " - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects—bundles of data and the functions (methods) that operate on that data.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2.What is a class in OOP?\n",
        " - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.\n",
        " 3.  What is an object in OOP?\n",
        " - an object is an instance of a class.\n",
        "It is a real, usable entity created from a class blueprint.\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "- Abstraction = focuses on what an object does.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation = focuses on how an object’s data is protected.\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "- Dunder methods in Python (short for double-underscore methods) are special built-in methods that start and end with two underscores.\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "- Inheritance enables a new class (called a child or subclass) to reuse, extend, or modify features of an existing class (called a parent or superclass).\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the ability of different objects to respond differently to the same function or method call.\n",
        "\n",
        "The word “polymorphism” comes from Greek:\n",
        "\n",
        "poly = many\n",
        "\n",
        "morph = forms\n",
        "So it literally means “many forms.”\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "- Encapsulation in Python is achieved by restricting direct access to an object's data and controlling it through methods.\n",
        "Python does this using naming conventions rather than strict access modifiers (like private/public in Java or C++).\n",
        "9.  What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "- In Python, a constructor is a special method used to initialize an object when it is created.\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "- In Python, class methods and static methods are special kinds of methods that belong to a class rather than an instance. They are defined using decorators.\n",
        "11. H What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "- Method overloading is a feature in many programming languages where multiple methods can have the same name but different parameters (different number or types of arguments).\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, true method overloading is not directly supported because if you define multiple methods with the same name, the last definition overrides the previous ones.\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "- Method overriding in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) occurs when a subclass provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "This allows a subclass to modify or extend the behavior of the parent class method.\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "- In Python, a property decorator (@property) is a built-in decorator that allows you to define methods in a class that can be accessed like attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is a way to encapsulate data while providing a clean, Pythonic interface for getting, setting, or deleting values.\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism is important in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) because it allows objects of different classes to be treated uniformly, enabling flexible, extensible, and maintainable code.\n",
        "15.  What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "- In Python, an abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is meant to be a blueprint for other classes. It can define abstract methods that must be implemented by any subclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstract classes are provided by the abc (Abstract Base Classes) module.\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) offers several advantages over procedural programming because it models real-world entities as objects, making code more organized, reusable, and maintainable.\n",
        "\n",
        "17.  What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "- **Simple Definitions:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Instance Variable:** A variable that belongs to a **specific object**. Each object has its **own copy**.\n",
        "* **Class Variable:** A variable that belongs to the **class** itself and is **shared by all objects** of that class.\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "- Multiple inheritance in Python is a feature where a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class.\n",
        "19. H Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "- In Python, __str__ and __repr__ are dunder (double underscore) methods used to define string representations of objects, but they serve slightly different purposes.\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "- In Python, the super() function is used to call a method from a parent (super) class inside a subclass. It is especially useful in inheritance, allowing you to reuse or extend functionality of the parent class without explicitly naming it.\n",
        "21.  What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "- In Python, the __del__ method is a destructor — a special method that is called when an object is about to be destroyed (i.e., when it is garbage collected).\n",
        "\n",
        "It is used to perform cleanup actions, such as releasing resources or closing files, before the object is removed from memory.\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "- **Simple Definitions:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **@staticmethod:** A method that **doesn’t access the class or instance**, used like a regular function inside a class.\n",
        "* **@classmethod:** A method that **accesses the class itself** via `cls` and can modify class-level attributes.\n",
        "23.  How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "-  Polymorphism in Python with inheritance allows a child class to override methods of its parent class, so that the same method call can behave differently depending on the object type. This is a form of runtime polymorphism.\n",
        "24.  What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "- Method chaining in Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a technique where multiple methods are called sequentially on the same object in a single line of code. This is achieved by having each method return the object itself, typically using return self.\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __call__ method in Python allows instances of a class to be called as if they were functions. When an object with a defined __call__ method is invoked using parentheses (e.g., my_object()), the __call__ method is automatically executed.\n",
        "The primary purpose of __call__ is to enable the creation of \"callable objects\" or \"functors,\" which are objects that combine the characteristics of both data and behavior. This can be useful in several scenarios:\n"
